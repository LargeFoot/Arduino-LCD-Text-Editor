# Arduino LCD Text Editor
Text editor program for LCDs using Arduino.

## How to use
Use an analog joystick(Y-axis pin to A0 ; X-axis pin to A1 ; switch pin to Digital-8) to scroll through and LCD. Hold down on the switch (press down on the analog joystick) to 
start editing. While holding, toggle downward with the joystick to change the character, then release to update.

### DISCLAIMER
A lot of bugs are in existence, and functionality is neither fluid nor enjoyable. The LCD screen won't show you the character while you're changing the text. Also, the text editor 
only goes up to 'G'
